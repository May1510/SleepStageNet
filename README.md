# SleepStageNet
Implementation about the sleep stage of a person using EEG and Neural Networks. The Sleep Stages can be categorised in 5 main categories namely Wake, S1, S2, REM, and Deepsleep.

Code for the model in the paper derived from DeepSleepNet: a Model for Automatic Sleep Stage Scoring based on Raw Single-Channel EEG by Akara Supratak, Hao Dong, Chao Wu, Yike Guo publication in arXiv. https://paperswithcode.com/paper/deepsleepnet-a-model-for-automatic-sleep

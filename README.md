# SleepStageNet
Implementation about the sleep stage of a person using EEG and Neural Networks. The Sleep Stages can be categorised in 5 main categories namely Wake, S1, S2, REM, and Deepsleep.

Code for the model in the paper derived from DeepSleepNet: a Model for Automatic Sleep Stage Scoring based on Raw Single-Channel EEG by Akara Supratak, Hao Dong, Chao Wu, Yike Guo publication in arXiv. https://paperswithcode.com/paper/deepsleepnet-a-model-for-automatic-sleep

The original code can be found here https://github.com/famousgrouse/AccSleepNet
This is just a modified implementation of this code with a few error fixes and some commented out unecessary code.
P.s My first Neural Network Project. :)

# Getting Started 
Install the required Dependencies.
The dataset can be found here https://www.physionet.org/physiobank/database/sleep-edfx/sleep-cassette/
Download the datasets one by one in the main folder of the project. 

# Run this model
Type the following command in the console of the project directory.

python main.py
